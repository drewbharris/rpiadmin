# rpitools


A collection of Python scripts for use on the Raspberry Pi.  Eventually this will be a nice module designed for doing common
tasks on the Raspberry Pi (well, specifically for my uses as a game and media console).

### components

Flask web server/admin panel with safe shutdown, reboot, system stats, etc. (in progress)

ROM import for use with RetroPie (in progress)

## install

    git clone
    cd rpitools
    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
